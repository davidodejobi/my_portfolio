# My Portfolio
My portfolio is a portfolio app that contains information about me and some projects I've worked on




## Features

- Automatically get the system mode(dark or light them)
- Change theme from dark to light and vice-versa
- Automatically get localization(L10n or local language) of the device
- Can change the language(localization) to 2 other languages apart from English
- Soothing, minimalistic animation and responsiveness
- Webview to open url link to view social media handles and projects


## Tech Stack

**Technology** Flutter, Dart

**Libraries** 

Provider: for state management,and passing of data back and forth the widget tree 

Webview flutter: for opening url and perform actions relating to urls/web in flutter.

Intl: used for localization.

Get_it: I didn't use it, I thought I will need to do some DI but it was not needed.


## Design Description


The portrait mode, uses a Silver app bar, and I used the values gotten while scrolling to move some of the object(something I saw in a tutorial months ago). Other things are pretty much widgets with either a normal container or glasmorphic design.

For the landscape, it something I just thought of from the air, sketched it out and build. Although, there were lots of modification along the way cause there wasn't a design to follow.
## Feature would like to add ...

- I would have love to fix 2 UI bugs(minor) on the app (1. Text not responding to dark theme text in drop down when selecting localization, 2. In the landscape mode, I wrote a loop to get the project cards and I did something there that wasn't dynamic with kinda wll introduct a divider bug)

- Make animation better by reading more about how stacks and animations work.

- Add languages such as Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba in L10n.

- Try to come up with a page for work experience

## Challenges

There are two main challenges I faced while working on the task: 


- Coming up with a design that I think looks presentable enough.
- Trying to build a simple, less distracting and classic kind of animation. Combining all of those, even makes it more difficult to build and implement but thanks to Google.
     and Mr. Sleepless nights 🖤).

The other boss challenge is juggling the tasks with other commitments (❁´◡`❁).
